## Entities

Entities are anything that can have an instance in the world and interacts with other entities (including the player themself).

1. Player Character
2. Creatures
3. Items
4. Skills
5. Terrain 
6. Etc...


> To maintain logical organization, each entity "should" contain most of the assets they employ when doing their functions.
